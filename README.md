## Summary

The idea is to create a simple and good loking terminal for being able to transmit to and from electronic boards and hardware. It can be configured to show data in hex or string format. It allows manual configuration of the port to use. It supports console mode, where data is sent right away a key is pressed, or traditional mode, where you write data in a line, chose a end delimiter and then send it with a button. It has utilities to convert text to hex and visceversa.
